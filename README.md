**Hestia** is an open-source, AI-powered nutrition assistant that helps you eat better, feel better, and live with rhythm â€” without calorie counting, guilt, or friction.

Inspired by the Greek goddess of the hearth, Hestia keeps your fire lit: planning meals, adapting to your health data, and gently guiding you toward consistency, joy, and self-care.

---

## Why Hestia?

Modern nutrition apps are built like spreadsheets and surveillance tools. Hestia is built like a good friend who:

- Knows what's in your pantry
- Understands your training, sleep, and schedule
- Gently nudges you with daily plans and seasonal recipes
- Helps you prep ahead, adapt dynamically, and reflect with kindness

No calories. No shame. No endless input boxes. Just care, rhythm, and delicious structure.

```

### Railway Deployment
The project is configured for automatic deployment on Railway:

1. **Connect to Railway**: 
   - Install Railway CLI: `npm i -g @railway/cli`
   - Login: `railway login`
   - Link project: `railway link`

2. **Deploy**: 
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

3. **Automatic Deployment**: Railway will automatically:
   - Install Python dependencies
   - Build Flutter web app
   - Start FastAPI server with static file serving
   - Deploy everything as a single service

### Environment-Specific Configs

- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
