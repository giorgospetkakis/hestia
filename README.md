# Hestia â€“ Your Daily Ritual for Nourishment & Rhythm

**Hestia** is an open-source, AI-powered nutrition assistant that helps you eat better, feel better, and live with rhythm â€” without calorie counting, guilt, or friction.

Inspired by the Greek goddess of the hearth, Hestia keeps your fire lit: planning meals, adapting to your health data, and gently guiding you toward consistency, joy, and self-care.

## Why Hestia?

Modern nutrition apps are built like spreadsheets and surveillance tools. Hestia is built like a good friend who:

- Knows whatâ€™s in your pantry
- Understands your training, sleep, and schedule
- Gently nudges you with daily plans and seasonal recipes
- Helps you prep ahead, adapt dynamically, and reflect with kindness

No calories. No shame. No endless input boxes. Just care, rhythm, and delicious structure.
